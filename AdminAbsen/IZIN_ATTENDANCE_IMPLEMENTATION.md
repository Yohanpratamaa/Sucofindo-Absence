# Izin-Attendance Integration - Implementation Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. Database Schema Updates

-   **Migration**: `2025_07_03_155837_add_izin_fields_to_attendances_table.php`
-   Added columns to `attendances` table:
    -   `izin_id` (foreign key to izins table)
    -   `status_kehadiran` (enum: Tepat Waktu, Terlambat, Tidak Hadir, Tidak Absensi, Izin, Sakit, Cuti)
    -   `keterangan_izin` (text, nullable)

### 2. Model Updates

-   **Attendance Model**: Updated `$fillable` array and added relationship to Izin
-   **Izin Model**: Enhanced with proper relationships and accessors
-   Added status accessors for handling different leave types (Izin, Sakit, Cuti)

### 3. Business Logic Implementation

-   **IzinAttendanceService**: Service class to handle automatic attendance creation/deletion
    -   Creates attendance records for each day in approved leave period
    -   Skips weekends (configurable)
    -   Handles overlap detection with existing attendance
    -   Supports leave modification and rejection scenarios

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture

-   **IzinObserver**: Automatically triggers attendance management
    -   Handles new approved Izin creation
    -   Handles Izin approval status changes
    -   Handles Izin rejection and deletion
    -   Registered in `AppServiceProvider`

### 5. UI Enhancements (Filament)

-   **MyAllAttendanceResource**: Enhanced to display leave information
    -   Added `keterangan_izin` column (visible when present)
    -   Enhanced status filters for Izin, Sakit, Cuti
    -   Added combined "Izin/Sakit/Cuti" filter
    -   Badge colors for different leave types
    -   Improved record highlighting for leave days

### 6. Test Data & Verification

-   **IzinAttendanceTestSeeder**: Comprehensive test data generator
    -   Creates approved leave requests with automatic attendance generation
    -   Creates pending leave requests for testing approval workflow
    -   Provides verification and usage instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ HOW IT WORKS

1. **When Izin is Approved**:

    - IzinObserver detects approval (created with approved status OR status change to approved)
    - IzinAttendanceService creates attendance records for each day in the leave period
    - Each attendance record has:
        - `izin_id` linking to the leave request
        - `status_kehadiran` matching the leave type (Izin/Sakit/Cuti)
        - `keterangan_izin` with leave description and details

2. **When Izin is Rejected/Deleted**:

    - Associated attendance records are automatically deleted
    - No orphaned attendance data remains

3. **When Izin Dates are Modified**:
    - Old attendance records are deleted
    - New attendance records are created for the updated period

## ðŸ“Š CURRENT TEST DATA

After running `IzinAttendanceTestSeeder`:

-   **5 Approved Izin** with automatic attendance creation
-   **2 Pending Izin** for testing approval workflow
-   **7 Attendance Records** created automatically (weekends excluded)

## ðŸ§ª HOW TO TEST

### 1. View Existing Data

```bash
# Navigate to Filament admin panel
# Go to "My All Attendance" page
# Use filters:
#   - "Izin/Sakit/Cuti" to see only leave-related attendance
#   - "Status Kehadiran" to filter by specific leave types
# Look for records with "Keterangan" column showing leave details
```

### 2. Test Approval Workflow

```bash
# In Filament admin panel:
# 1. Go to Izin management page
# 2. Find pending Izin requests
# 3. Approve one of them
# 4. Check "My All Attendance" page
# 5. Verify new attendance records appear automatically
```

### 3. Generate Fresh Test Data

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=IzinAttendanceTestSeeder
```

### 4. Verify Data Integrity

```bash
# Check approved izin count
php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'Approved Izin: ' . App\Models\Izin::whereNotNull('approved_at')->count() . PHP_EOL;"

# Check automatic attendance creation
php artisan tinker --execute="echo 'Attendance with Izin: ' . App\Models\Attendance::whereNotNull('izin_id')->count() . PHP_EOL;"
```
